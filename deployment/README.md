> Provision an **Iconoflix** application using deployments.

1. Create a deployment named *iconoflix* (see k8s/iconoflix.yml)
   1. Using image: [Iconoflix](https://quay.io/repository/imhotepio/iconoflix)
   2. Use the tag `mem`
   3. Use label selector `app=iconoflix`
2. Launch your deployment
3. Ensure the deployment is up and running and image is using the correct tag
4. Now update the Iconoflix docker image to use tag **:file**
5. Make sure the deployment is running and the image has been updated
6. Next scale up the deployment to 5 instances
7. Check rollout status and history
8. Rollback your deployment to initial tag version **:mem**
9. Check rollout status and make sure it completes
10. Verify the pod is running the correct image
11. Delete your entire application
